# fileIntegrityMonitor

// Building a basic file integrity monitor 
// First user will be asked what they want to do. 
// The user will be able to begin monitoring files with saved baseline
// The FIM will continously monitor file integrity by looping through each file target, calculating the hash, and comparing the file/hash to the baseline.txt
// The user will be notified if a file is changed or deleted
// I begin by creating some files to monitor in the "Files" folder there are 4 .txt documents for demonstration purposes


// Testing exsisting code to ensure files can be pulled from target folder
